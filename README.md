# Google-Sheets-Functions

This is my personal Database for Google Appscript Funcitons I have used.

Awesome Appscript is an open source project aimed at providing a comprehensive resource for developers looking to work with Google Appscript and its SDK. The repository includes detailed documentation, sample code, and other useful information for getting started and working effectively with Appscript. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project aims to make it easy to understand and work with Appscript. Contributions are welcome and encouraged!

If i continue getting some cool stars, I'll probably end up structuring with links and resources.

Feel free to copy and paste them as I do every day :)
