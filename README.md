A curated list of resources for Google Apps Script, a scripting language based on JavaScript that lets you automate tasks and extend Google Workspace.

I've been working on the automation industry for a bit now. There is no time when I won't think of a spreadsheet and appscript inn the back backing a 10x improvement. Having the possibility to make API calls and integrating some JS on it is insane.

I still remember my first days creating emailing marketing with html template and saving hours, days of data entry. I owe Appscript a lot, this is my way of getting more people into it and thanking the ecosystem.

Introduction
------------
Before getting into appscript I would just start using Google Sheets or Excel. Build some template and cool functionalities that let you understand how that works, there a ton of content on those topics and projects you can pick up in no time.

Once you have some confidence on google sheets, I would dive deep into the basics of Javascript.

Just when you know how for, if and while loops work you can start here. A channel that help me a lot was [ExcelGoogleSheet](https://www.youtube.com/@ExcelGoogleSheets). Didn't actually go video by video but always runned into him.

Don't spend too much on the basics. Just start building an idea. Emailing list, a specific tepmlate that search with APIs, bring some JS libraries to a sheet.

This awesome list is a collection of resources that will help you get started with Google Apps Script and take your skills to the next level.
